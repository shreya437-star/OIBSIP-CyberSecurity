Task 5: Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks
Objective
The objective of Task 5 is to research and prepare a detailed report on social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and baiting. This task aims to create awareness about how attackers exploit human psychology and to suggest preventive measures to reduce such cyber threats.
Introduction
Social engineering attacks are cybersecurity threats that manipulate individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of targeting technical vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human emotions like trust, fear, urgency, and curiosity. Due to this, social engineering attacks are highly effective and commonly used by cybercriminals.
Types of Social Engineering Attacks
1. Phishing
Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers send fake emails, messages, or links that appear to come from trusted sources. These messages trick users into sharing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or banking details.
Example:
Fake emails from banks or Google asking users to “verify” account details.
2. Pretexting
Pretexting involves attackers creating a false scenario or identity to gain trust and extract confidential information from victims.
Example:
An attacker pretends to be an IT support employee and asks for login credentials to fix a fake issue.
3. Baiting
Baiting attacks lure victims by offering something attractive such as free software, movies, or USB drives infected with malware.
Example:
Infected USB drives labeled “Confidential Data” left in public places.
Case Studies of Social Engineering Attacks
Case Study 1: Gmail Phishing Attack
In 2017, a phishing attack targeted Gmail users by sending fake Google Docs invitations. Once users clicked the link, attackers gained access to their email accounts.
Impact:
Unauthorized email access
Data leakage
Spread of phishing links
Case Study 2: Twitter Social Engineering Attack (2020)
Attackers used social engineering to manipulate Twitter employees and gained access to internal systems, compromising verified accounts.
Impact:
Financial loss
Reputation damage
Highlighted insider threats
Impact on Organizations
Financial losses
Data breaches
Loss of customer trust
Legal and compliance issues
Operational disruption
Prevention of Social Engineering Attacks
Awareness and cybersecurity training
Verifying emails and links before clicking
Using multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Strong organizational security policies
Regular security audits
Conclusion
Task 5 highlights how social esngineering attacks exploit human behavior rather than technical flaws. Phishing, pretexting, and baiting attacks pose serious risks to individuals and organizations. Proper awareness, training, and security practices are essential to prevent such attacks and protect sensitive information.
